## Business Narative
Timetable is a piece of important document not only for the students but also for all stakeholders involved in an education institution i.e. lecturers, program leaders, and admin staff. Currently, the timetable distributed to all students are manually generated where the scheduler will arrange and key in the schedule of classes for each module into a room booking system called SPlus. However, SPlus could not generate a custom timetable or layout based on PSB requirement as shown in figure 1 as this system is a proprietary software.

In this project, you have been assigned to develop a console or GUI timetable viewer and PDF generator application. The conceptual diagram in Figure 2 below illustrates the process for the timetable viewer and PDF generator application.

This application will first load all excel spreadsheet generated by SPlus which is made available to you and can be downloaded from Blackboard. The program should ask user where the raw data located (folder) so all data can be loaded and processed at once. No modification can be made on the raw data or csv file. The data must be stored with appropriate data structure once it is loaded.

Among fields to be used and processed including name, description, activity dates, scheduled days, scheduled start time, scheduled end time, duration,
allocated location name, allocated staff name and zone name. You may discard all other data from the spreadsheet or decided make use it if deem appropriate. There are also some other data which will be useful to be included in the system i.e. Year, month of intake, student batch/cohort i.e. DICT221 and mode of study i.e. Fulltime or Parttime. As there might be more information to be added in future and therefore, you are required to design and encapsulate appropriate information as class and form relationship among them.

Once the raw data is loaded and processed, the program will allow user to list down schedules based on their selection for example list all sessions by module name, lecturer name or the date range given.

When listing the schedule, the application must display information such as the module name, the date, the start time, end time, venue, and the lecturer name. The program should ensure valid input are provided. The program should respond with appropriate error message if user supplied invalid input. For best usability and prevent input error, it is always recommended to provide user list of options rather than requesting user to type in exact value for their selection.
